# Welcome to my GitHub world! 

I am from China. I grew up in Gobi desert in Gansu Province, China and since my childhood, I have learned to be adaptive, persistent, humble but not invasive. I have accumulated 20+ years of working experience in software development, 10+ years in cybersecurity, and 7+ years in management that is summarized [here](https://github.com/therightwei/aboutme/blob/main/introduction.md).

I built a strong academic foundation in mathematics from college and graduate study at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) and did large scale numerical analysis to calculate stress and strain distribution in oil fields. I had used Fortran language and C++ language and wrote more code than I had writen when I pursued my Master's degree of computer science at [University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu). I had programmed using assembly language, Perl/CGI, groovy, C and Java for fun.  

I am a Tai Chi practioner and master for more than 30 years. I practice the traditional Chen style, not the popular style. When I picked up golf, I found it is even more interesting. I learned many life lessons from golfing. I have connected with many nice people through golfing and appreciate the abundance of golf resource. I believe Tai Chi can help golfing because I reached my lowest handicap 5.4 in less than 10 years by only playing during the weekend.

I hope you enjoy life as much as I do!
