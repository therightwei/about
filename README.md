# Welcome to my GitHub world! 

I am from China. I grew up in the heart of the Gobi Desert in Gansu Province, China, where I learned to be adaptive, persistent, and humble from an early age.  

I built a strong academic foundation in mathematics during my college and graduate studies at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). There, I programmed with Fortran and C++ language to perform large scale numerical analysis to calculate stress and strain distribution in complext structures. In fact, I wrote more code during this time than I did when pursing my Master's degree of computer science at [University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu). 

With [over 20 years of experience in software development, more than a decade in cybersecurity, and 7+ years in management](https://github.com/therightwei/aboutme/blob/main/introduction.md), I have honed a unique blend of technical expertise and leadership skills in software development and security. My diverse background and relentless drive have empowered me to navigate complex challenges and innovate in the ever-evolving technology landscape.

I am a Tai Chi practioner and master for more than 30 years. I practice the traditional Chen style, not the popular style. When I picked up golf, I found it is even more interesting. I learned many life lessons from golfing. I have connected with many nice people through golfing and appreciate the abundance of golf resource. I believe Tai Chi can help golfing because I reached my lowest handicap 5.4 in less than 10 years by only playing during the weekend.

I have been a dedicated Tai Chi practitioner and master for over 30 years, specializing in the traditional Chen style, which holds rich styles and a long history compared to the more popular styles. When I took up golf, I discovered it to be equally fascinating. Golf has taught me numerous life lessons and allowed me to connect with many wonderful people, for which I am grateful.

I believe that Tai Chi has enhanced my golfing skills. The principles of balance, focus, and controlled movement have contributed to my success on the golf course. Remarkably, I achieved a handicap of 5.4 within less than 10 years, despite only playing on weekends.  

I hope you enjoy life as much as I do!
